                <h1>FC Bayern's Fines Moments</h1>
                <hr>
                <section>
                    <h2>27 February 1900 - Formation</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">On 27 February 1900, 11 young men, led by Bayern's future first president Franz John, 
                        founded FC Bayern at Café Gisela in Munich, laying the foundation for what would become a thoroughly 
                        successful history of the German record champions.</p>
                    <h2>1932 - First German title</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">A club from Munich was crowned German champions for the very first time. Bayern beat
                         Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 in the final.</p>
                    <h2>1957 - First DFB Cup triumph</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Bayern won the DFB Cup for the first time thanks to a 1-0 win over Fortuna Düsseldorf
                         in the final. Rudi Jobst scored the goal</p>
                    <h2>1962 - First European match</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">In October 1962, Bayern made their first appearance on the European stage. They beat 
                        Basel 3-0 in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup</p>
                    <h2>1965 - Promotion to the Bundesliga</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Bayern stormed to the title in the Regionalliga Süd with a remarkable goal difference 
                        of 146-32. They thrashed Tennis Borussia Berlin 8-0 in the play-offs to clinch promotion to the recently 
                        formed top flight.</p>
                    <h2>1967 - European Cup Winners' Cup</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Just two years after promotion to the Bundesliga, Bayern lifted the European Cup Winners' Cup 
                        after beating Glasgow Rangers 1-0 after extra time.</p>
                    <h2>1971 - Biggest Bundesliga win</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Bayern recorded the biggest Bundesliga win in the club's history, 11-1 against Borussia Dortmund
                         on 27 November 1971.</p>
                    <h2>1972 - Move to Olympiastadion</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">The Olympiastadion, completed in 1972, is the first stadium with undersoil heating and VIP boxes.
                         FCB beat Schalke 5-1 in their first game there in June 1972 to seal their third league title.</p>
                    <h2>1974 - European Cup</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Bayern conquered the continent and become the first German team to win the European Cup. The replay
                         against Atletico Madrid ended in a convincing 4-0 victory thanks to braces from Gerd Müller and Uli Hoeneß.</p>
                    <h2>1975 - European Cup title defended</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Bayern marked their 75th anniversary by defending their European Cup crown. The Munich side beat Leeds
                         United 2-0 in the final with goals from Franz 'Bulle' Roth and Müller.</p>
                    <h2>1976 - Third consecutive European Cup & Intercontinental Cup</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Good things come in threes: Roth scored the only goal in the final against Saint-Etienne to earn FCB 
                        their third consecutive European Cup title. Bayern followed that by becoming the first German club ever to lift the
                         Intercontinental Cup. The Munich men won 2-0 in the first leg of the final against Cruzeiro thanks to goals from 
                         Gerd Müller and Jupp Kapellmann, with the return leg in Brazil ending goalless.</p>
                    <h2>1979 - Uli Hoeneß becomes general manager</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">On 1 May 1979, Uli Hoeneß moved into a management role at FC Bayern, becoming the youngest general manager
                         in Bundesliga history at the age of 27. He turned the German record champions into a global brand and oversaw countless
                          successes with the club.</p>
                    <h2>1983 - Biggest European win</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Bayern recorded their biggest win in the European Cup, thrashing Anorthosis Famagusta 10-0. The second-highest
                         also came against a side from Cyprus (9-0 against APOEL FC).</p>
                    <h2>1987 - New German record champions</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">With their tenth league title in 1987, Bayern ousted 1. FC Nürnberg as Germany's most successful club.</p>
                    <h2>1996 - UEFA Cup glory</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Bayern lifted the UEFA Cup with a 5-1 aggregate victory over Bordeaux and had now won all three major European
                         titles. At the time, only four other clubs have achieved that feat (Manchester United, Juventus, Chelsea and Ajax). 
                         Incidentally, all five clubs also won the UEFA Super Cup.</p>
                    <h2>2001 - 'Big ears' back in Munich</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Bayern won the new Champions League for the first time, beating Valencia 5-4 on penalties, to bring Europe's
                         most coveted trophy back to Munich after a 25-year absence.</p>
                    <h2>2005 - Move to the Allianz Arena</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Bayern moved into the new arena in Fröttmaning together with 1860 München. The stadium now has a capacity of
                         75,000 and has become the exclusive home of FC Bayern.</p>
                    <h2>2013 - The treble year</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">FC Bayern became the first German team and the seventh in Europe to win the continental treble. Having already
                         won the Bundesliga title on Matchday 28 and finished the campaign 25 points ahead of nearest challengers Dortmund, they beat
                          the Black and Yellows again 2-1 in the first ever all-German Champions League final at Wembley. One week later, the record
                           champions completed the treble with a 3-2 victory against Stuttgart in the DFB Cup final.</p>
                    <h2>2020/21 - Six titles in one year</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">Bayern are the only second club in the world after Barcelona to win six titles in one year. After their 30th
                         championship and 20th cup successes, the men from Munich triumphed in the finals tournament of the Champions League in 
                         Lisbon, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 in the final through a Kingsley Coman goal. Coach Hansi Flick's team went on
                          to win the UEFA Super Cup and the German Supercup. The crowning glory came in February 2021, when Bayern beat the other
                           continental champions to become the best team in the world at the FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
                    <h2>2020/21 - Lewandowski's fairytale year</h2>
                    <p class="pleft">One man has stood above the rest in the last couple of years of Bayern's history. After celebrating six 
                        titles in 12 months with the team, top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski was named The Best FIFA Men's Player in December
                         2020, becoming the first Bayern player to ever win FIFA's award for the best player on the planet. But Lewy doesn't
                          like to rest on his successes. In the 2020/21 Bundesliga campaign, our number nine broke the age-old record set by
                           FCB legend Gerd Müller, scoring 41 goals to earn his place in the history books. In January 2022, the Pole defended
                            his title as The Best FIFA Men's Player.</p>
